## THIS IS A BIG DATA ANALYSIS ON A LARGE DATASET OF FLIGHTS.CSV FILE. I HAVE DONE ANALYSIS ON THIS USING DASK WHICH IS BEST SUITED FOR DOING ANALYSIS ON LARGER DATSETS BECAUSE IT CAN GIVE OUTPUTS IN A LESS TIME UNLESS PANDAS OR NUMPY'S WHICH WILL TAKE A LONGER TIME DOING COMPUTATIONS AND IMPLEMENTING RESULTS. AS A BEGINNER I HAVE DONE SOME BASIC EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYTICS ON THIS DATASET WHICH INCLUDES QUESTIONS LIKE AVERAGE DEPARTURE DELAY OR ARRIVAL DELAY AND MANY MORE QUESTIONS LIKE COUNT AND SUM OF SELECTED COLUMNS. I HAVE SHOWN HOW TO DROP NULL VALUES AND INCLUDE NEW COLUMNS. I HAVE DONE VISUALIZATIONS WHICH INCLUDE BAR GRAPH AND PIE CHARTS AS WELL WHICH WILL GIVE MORE CLARITY TO THE PICTURE OF HOW THINGS ARE WORKING. THE FILE WHICH I HAVE USED IS A CSV FILE IN EXCEL WHICH I HAVE IMPORTED HERE INTO THIS ANALYSIS TO USE.##
